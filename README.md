# Consistent Localization II Final Mix

This mod is part of a series intended to make subtle adjustments to the English localizations of the Kingdom Hearts games so that they better align with one another.

## Installation

Mod can be installed using the OpenKH Mod Manager. Simply open the Mod Manager, click the green + button, type `SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationKH2` into the text box, then click `Install`.

This mod had a small change made specifically for the [KH Re:Fined](https://github.com/KH-ReFined/KH-ReFined) mod by TopazTK (also known as Re:Fixed and Re:Freshed). If you aren't using that mod, ignore this paragraph. If you are, be sure to install this mod ABOVE the [KH-ReFined/KH2-MAIN](https://github.com/KH-ReFined/KH2-MAIN) patch.

## Links
If you do not use the OpenKH Mod Manager or prefer to use .kh2pcpatch files in favor of GitHub repos, you can download the mod from Nexus Mods:
